## Introduction

Workflow automation has become essential for modern businesses, but deploying and managing these systems at scale—especially with AI capabilities—presents unique challenges. n8n, an open-source workflow automation platform, offers a powerful alternative to tools like Zapier and Make.com, with the added benefit of self-hosting for data sovereignty and customization.

In this guide, we'll walk through deploying n8n with an integrated Ollama AI server using Nuon. This setup demonstrates how software vendors can deliver enterprise-grade, AI-powered workflow automation as a fully managed, self-hosted solution directly into customer cloud accounts.

## What is n8n?

n8n is a fair-code licensed workflow automation tool that lets users create complex automations by connecting different services and APIs. Think of it as a self-hosted alternative to Zapier, but with more flexibility, transparency, and control over your data.

Key features include:
- **Visual workflow builder** with 400+ integrations
- **Custom code execution** (JavaScript/Python)
- **AI and LLM nodes** for intelligent automation
- **Webhook support** for real-time triggers
- **Self-hosted deployment** for data privacy

By integrating Ollama, we add local AI model inference capabilities, enabling workflows to leverage language models without external API dependencies or costs.

## Why Self-Host n8n with AI?

For enterprises and software vendors, self-hosting n8n with Ollama offers several advantages:

1. **Data Sovereignty**: All workflow data and AI processing stays within the customer's infrastructure
2. **Cost Control**: No per-execution pricing or API call charges for AI features
3. **Customization**: Full control over AI models, workflow configurations, and integrations
4. **Compliance**: Meet strict regulatory requirements by keeping data in-house
5. **Performance**: Reduced latency with local AI inference

However, deploying a multi-service application like n8n—with PostgreSQL, Redis, worker nodes, and an AI server—across multiple customer environments can be operationally complex. This is where Nuon comes in.

## Architecture Overview

The n8n application on Nuon consists of several interconnected components:

### Core Application Services

- **n8n Main**: The primary web interface and API server
- **n8n Workers**: Background job processors for workflow execution
- **PostgreSQL**: Persistent storage for workflows, credentials, and execution history
- **Redis**: Message queue and caching layer for distributed execution
- **Ollama Server**: Local AI model inference server

### Infrastructure Components

Each installation runs in an isolated Amazon EKS cluster with:
- **VPC and Networking**: Isolated network environment per customer
- **Ingress Controller**: HTTPS access to the n8n web interface
- **Persistent Storage**: EBS volumes for database and AI model storage
- **IAM Roles**: Secure, scoped permissions via IRSA

```

## Component Configuration

The n8n app is defined declaratively using Nuon's component system. Each component represents a deployable unit with its own configuration, dependencies, and lifecycle.

### PostgreSQL Database

PostgreSQL serves as the primary data store for n8n, holding workflows, credentials, execution history, and user data.

```toml
#:schema https://api.nuon.co/v1/general/config-schema?type=helm
name           = "postgres_db"
type           = "helm_chart"
chart_name     = "postgresql"
namespace      = "n8n"
storage_driver = "configmap"
timeout        = "15m"

[public_repo]
repo      = "nuonco/example-app-configs"
directory = "n8n/src/helm/postgresql"
branch    = "main"

[[values_file]]
contents = "./values/postgres/postgres.yaml"
```

The PostgreSQL configuration includes:
- **Persistent storage** with 20GB default (configurable via inputs)
- **Resource limits** tuned for workflow execution patterns
- **Security context** for proper file permissions
- **Alpine-based image** for smaller footprint

### Redis Cache and Queue

Redis handles two critical functions: caching for performance and message queuing for distributed workflow execution.

```yaml
image:
  repository: redis
  tag: "7-alpine"

persistence:
  enabled: true
  size: 10Gi
  storageClass: gp2

resources:
  requests:
    memory: "256Mi"
    cpu: "100m"
  limits:
    memory: "1Gi"
    cpu: "500m"
```

### n8n Main Application

The main n8n service provides the web interface and API. It's configured with environment variables that control behavior, logging, and integrations.

Key configuration highlights:

```yaml
image:
  repository: n8nio/n8n
  tag: latest

replicas: 1

persistence:
  enabled: true
  size: 10Gi
  storageClass: gp2

securityContext:
  fsGroup: 1000
  runAsUser: 1000
  runAsGroup: 1000
```

The `securityContext` is crucial—it ensures the n8n process (running as user ID 1000) has write permissions to the persistent volume for storing workflow data and configurations.

### n8n Workers

Worker nodes execute workflows in the background, allowing the main application to remain responsive. They connect to the same PostgreSQL and Redis instances.

```yaml
replicas: 2  # Scale based on workload

env:
  EXECUTIONS_MODE: "queue"
  QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_HOST: "redis-master"
  QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_PORT: "6379"
```

Workers can be scaled independently based on workflow execution volume, providing flexibility for different customer workloads.

### Ollama AI Server

The Ollama component provides local AI model inference capabilities. This is where the magic happens for AI-powered workflows.

```yaml
image:
  repository: ollama/ollama
  tag: latest

replicas: 1

persistence:
  enabled: true
  size: 50Gi  # AI models require significant storage
  storageClass: gp2

resources:
  requests:
    memory: "1Gi"
    cpu: "500m"
  limits:
    memory: "4Gi"
    cpu: "2000m"
```

The Ollama server is configured for CPU-only inference by default, making it cost-effective for most use cases. For GPU acceleration, the configuration can be extended with node selectors and device plugins.

## Configuration Templating and Inputs

One of Nuon's strengths is its templating system, which allows a single app configuration to work across multiple customer environments with different requirements.

### User-Configurable Inputs

The `inputs.toml` file defines parameters that can be customized per installation:

```toml
[[group]]
name         = "infrastructure"
description  = "Core infrastructure settings"
display_name = "Infrastructure"

[[input]]
name         = "db_storage_gb"
description  = "PostgreSQL storage size in GB"
default      = "20"
display_name = "Database Storage (GB)"
group        = "infrastructure"

[[input]]
name         = "log_level"
description  = "Application log level"
default      = "info"
display_name = "Log Level"
group        = "infrastructure"

[[group]]
name         = "ai"
description  = "AI and LLM configuration with Ollama"
display_name = "AI Settings"

[[input]]
name         = "ollama_storage_gb"
description  = "Storage size for Ollama models in GB"
default      = "50"
display_name = "Ollama Storage (GB)"
group        = "ai"

[[input]]
name         = "ollama_model"
description  = "Ollama model to pull and use"
default      = "tinyllama"
display_name = "Ollama Model"
group        = "ai"
```

These inputs are then referenced throughout the configuration using Go template syntax:

```yaml
persistence:
  size: {{ .nuon.install.inputs.db_storage_gb }}Gi

env:
  N8N_LOG_LEVEL: {{ .nuon.install.inputs.log_level }}
```

### Component Dependencies

Components can depend on each other, ensuring proper deployment order:

```toml
[[components]]
name = "n8n_main"
type = "helm_chart"
dependencies = ["postgres_db", "redis", "ollama_server"]
```

This ensures PostgreSQL, Redis, and Ollama are fully deployed before n8n attempts to start.

## Networking and Ingress

The n8n web interface is exposed via a Kubernetes Ingress resource, which automatically provisions an AWS Application Load Balancer.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: n8n-ingress
  namespace: n8n
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: alb
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: internet-facing
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type: ip
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/listen-ports: '[{"HTTPS":443}]'
spec:
  rules:
    - host: "{{ .nuon.install.sandbox.outputs.nuon_dns.public_domain.name }}"
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: n8n-main
                port:
                  number: 5678
```

Nuon automatically:
- Provisions the ALB
- Configures DNS records
- Manages TLS certificates
- Routes traffic to the n8n service

Importantly, **Ollama is not exposed externally**. It's only accessible within the Kubernetes cluster via the internal service URL:

```
http://ollama-server.n8n.svc.cluster.local:11434
```

This keeps AI inference secure and isolated within the customer's environment.

## AI Model Management

One of the unique aspects of this deployment is automated AI model management. When a customer installs n8n, they can specify which Ollama model to use. A Nuon action then automatically downloads and configures that model.

### Pull Ollama Model Action

```toml
name    = "pull_ollama_model"
timeout = "30m"

[[triggers]]
type = "manual"

[[steps]]
name = "manage_models"
inline_contents = """
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "=== DOWNLOADING AI MODEL FOR N8N ==="

# Get the ollama pod
OLLAMA_POD=$(kubectl get pods -n n8n -l app=ollama -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')

if [ -z "$OLLAMA_POD" ]; then
    echo "❌ Error: No Ollama pod found"
    exit 1
fi

MODEL="tinyllama:1.1b"

echo "🔄 Downloading $MODEL..."
echo "This may take a few minutes..."

if kubectl exec -n n8n $OLLAMA_POD -- ollama pull $MODEL; then
    echo "✅ Successfully downloaded $MODEL"
else
    echo "⚠️  Failed to download $MODEL"
    exit 1
fi

echo ""
echo "🎉 Model download completed!"
echo "🎯 Ollama endpoint: http://ollama-server.n8n.svc.cluster.local:11434"
echo "💡 Use this URL in your n8n AI nodes!"
"""
```

This action can be triggered manually after installation or automated as part of the deployment workflow.

## Building AI-Powered Workflows

Once deployed, users can create workflows that leverage the Ollama AI server. Here's a simple example of a chat automation:

### Example: AI Chat Workflow

1. **Chat Trigger**: Receives messages from users
2. **HTTP Request**: Sends the message to Ollama for processing
   - URL: `http://ollama-server.n8n.svc.cluster.local:11434/api/generate`
   - Method: POST
   - Body: 
     ```json
     {
       "model": "tinyllama:1.1b",
       "prompt": "{{ $json.chatInput }}",
       "stream": false
     }
     ```
3. **Respond to Chat**: Returns the AI-generated response to the user

This workflow enables conversational AI capabilities entirely within the customer's infrastructure, with no external API calls or data leaving their environment.

## Deployment Workflow

Deploying n8n with Nuon follows a structured, approval-based process that gives vendors control while automating the heavy lifting.

### 1. Vendor Initiates Installation

The process begins in the Nuon dashboard:
- Select the n8n app
- Configure installation inputs (region, storage sizes, AI model, etc.)
- Specify the target customer account

### 2. Customer Onboarding

The customer connects their AWS account using a CloudFormation stack that grants Nuon the necessary IAM permissions. This is a one-time setup that establishes trust between Nuon and the customer's account.

### 3. Infrastructure Provisioning

Nuon automatically provisions:
- VPC and networking components
- EKS cluster with appropriate node groups
- IAM roles and service accounts
- Storage classes and persistent volumes

### 4. Component Deployment

Components are deployed in dependency order:
1. PostgreSQL database
2. Redis cache
3. Ollama AI server
4. n8n main application
5. n8n workers
6. Ingress and networking

At each stage, vendors can review and approve changes through the Nuon dashboard, with detailed diffs showing exactly what will be created or modified.

### 5. Post-Deployment Configuration

After deployment:
- The AI model is automatically downloaded via the pull action
- DNS records are configured
- TLS certificates are provisioned
- The n8n instance is accessible at the configured domain

## Day-2 Operations

Beyond initial deployment, Nuon provides tools for ongoing management and maintenance.

### Health Checks

Built-in health check actions verify that all components are running correctly:

```toml
name = "health_check"
timeout = "5m"

[[steps]]
name = "check_all_pods"
inline_contents = """
#!/bin/bash
echo "=== Checking n8n Components ==="
kubectl get pods -n n8n
kubectl get svc -n n8n
kubectl get ingress -n n8n
"""
```

### Workflow Backups

Automated backup actions protect customer workflow data:

```toml
name = "backup_workflows"
timeout = "10m"

[[triggers]]
type = "cron"
schedule = "0 2 * * *"  # Daily at 2 AM

[[steps]]
name = "backup_database"
inline_contents = """
#!/bin/bash
BACKUP_DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
kubectl exec -n n8n postgres-0 -- pg_dump -U n8n n8n > backup_${BACKUP_DATE}.sql
# Upload to S3 or customer's backup solution
"""
```

### Scaling and Updates

Vendors can adjust resources dynamically:
- Scale worker replicas based on workload
- Update to new n8n versions
- Change AI models
- Adjust storage allocations

All changes go through the same approval workflow, ensuring visibility and control.

## Key Technical Challenges and Solutions

Building this n8n app involved solving several interesting challenges:

### 1. File Permissions

**Challenge**: n8n runs as user ID 1000 (the `node` user), but Kubernetes persistent volumes default to root ownership.

**Solution**: Set `securityContext` in the deployment:
```yaml
securityContext:
  fsGroup: 1000
  runAsUser: 1000
  runAsGroup: 1000
```

This ensures the n8n process has write access to its data directory.

### 2. Worker Queue Configuration

**Challenge**: Coordinating multiple worker nodes with the main application for distributed execution.

**Solution**: Use Redis as a message queue with Bull, configured via environment variables:
```yaml
env:
  EXECUTIONS_MODE: "queue"
  QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_HOST: "redis-master"
  QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_PORT: "6379"
```

### 3. AI Model Storage

**Challenge**: AI models can be several gigabytes in size and need persistent storage.

**Solution**: Provision a dedicated 50GB persistent volume for Ollama with the `gp2` storage class, ensuring models persist across pod restarts.

### 4. Internal Service Communication

**Challenge**: n8n workflows need to communicate with Ollama without exposing it externally.

**Solution**: Use Kubernetes internal DNS:
```
http://ollama-server.n8n.svc.cluster.local:11434
```

This keeps AI inference traffic within the cluster while allowing n8n to access it.

### 5. Resource Optimization

**Challenge**: Balancing performance with cost, especially for CPU-intensive AI workloads.

**Solution**: Carefully tuned resource requests and limits:
- Ollama: 500m CPU request, 2 CPU limit (burst capability)
- n8n Main: 500m CPU request, 1.5 CPU limit
- Workers: 250m CPU request, 1 CPU limit

This provides good performance while keeping costs reasonable for most workloads.

## Security Considerations

Security is built into every layer of the deployment:

### Network Isolation

- Each installation runs in its own VPC
- Ollama is not exposed externally
- Only the n8n web interface is accessible via HTTPS

### IAM and Permissions

- IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts) for secure AWS API access
- Scoped permissions per component
- No long-lived AWS credentials stored in pods

### Data Encryption

- TLS for all external traffic
- Encrypted persistent volumes
- Secrets management via Kubernetes secrets (can be integrated with AWS Secrets Manager)

### Secrets Management

For production deployments, sensitive values like database passwords and encryption keys should be managed through Nuon's secrets system:

```toml
[[secret]]
name = "postgres_password"
display_name = "PostgreSQL Password"
description = "PostgreSQL database password for n8n"

[[secret]]
name = "n8n_encryption_key"
display_name = "n8n Encryption Key"
description = "Encryption key for n8n credentials storage"
```

These can be set via the Nuon dashboard and are securely injected at runtime.

## Performance and Scaling

The architecture is designed to scale with customer needs:

### Horizontal Scaling

- **Workers**: Scale from 1 to 10+ based on workflow execution volume
- **Redis**: Can be configured with replicas for high availability
- **PostgreSQL**: Can be upgraded to larger instance types or migrated to RDS

### Vertical Scaling

- Node instance types can be adjusted via inputs
- Resource requests/limits can be tuned per customer
- Storage can be expanded without downtime

### Monitoring

Integration with customer monitoring tools:
- Prometheus metrics from n8n
- Kubernetes metrics via metrics-server
- Custom CloudWatch dashboards
- Log aggregation via CloudWatch Logs or customer SIEM

## Cost Optimization

Running n8n with AI capabilities can be cost-effective with the right configuration:

### Infrastructure Costs

For a typical small-to-medium deployment:
- **EKS Cluster**: ~$75/month (control plane)
- **EC2 Nodes**: ~$150-300/month (2-3 t3a.large instances)
- **Storage**: ~$20-30/month (EBS volumes)
- **Load Balancer**: ~$20/month
- **Data Transfer**: Variable based on usage

**Total**: ~$265-425/month per customer installation

### AI Model Selection

Model choice significantly impacts resource requirements:
- **tinyllama (1.1B params)**: Minimal resources, fast inference, good for simple tasks
- **llama3.2:3b**: Moderate resources, better quality
- **mistral (7B params)**: Higher resources, production-quality responses

Customers can choose based on their quality/cost tradeoff.

### Optimization Tips

1. **Use CPU-only inference** for most workloads (GPU adds significant cost)
2. **Scale workers dynamically** based on actual workflow volume
3. **Use spot instances** for worker nodes (workflows can tolerate interruptions)
4. **Implement workflow execution limits** to prevent runaway costs
5. **Archive old execution data** to reduce database storage
